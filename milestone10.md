# Elevator Pitch

## What are you trying to do? 
   We are trying to make an app that people to be able to know what's going on around them. We want people to be able to know for example what events are currently happening around them, or what sales are going on, etc.

## How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practive?
   Today people usually have to go to facebook, or learn from a friend with connections to know what type of events are going on around them. The limit to this is, these events aren't just there for people to see, they have to be invited to them, or actively search for events. To know about what type of sales are around them, or how long restaurant waits are, people again have to actively search online. Also, for the events, you won't know if it's actually good or not until you are there.

## What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
   What's new about our approach is that you don't have to know anybody/have connections, nor do you have to actively search for events or sales around you. You simply have to open the app, and see the events all types of people are talking about, see what type of sales are going on, or how long restaurant waits are. Also for things like events, this app will let people know which one's are worth going to, with the upvote and comment system. 

## Who cares? If you're successful, what difference will it make?
   This app will make a difference to all people who want to know about what's going on around them. For example, someone who is visiting, and has no connections to the area, and therefore doesn't know what to do, or what's going on around them.It'll make a differnce to people who want to know what type of sales are around them or how long the wait is for a certain restaurant. Or people who are bored, who have nothing to do and want to go to a fun event last minute, spontaneous people.
