## Project Title
Déjà Moo

## Summary
Communicate with other users in your nearby region! Experience what they're
experiencing; experience Déjà Moo.

## Storyboard
Ideas:
1. Dropping a pin at a job fair for a good company that has a lot of recruiters
2. Dropping a pin on the I-5 to warn people about a traffic accident
3. Dropping a pin at a restaurant warning people about the wait times.
4. Dropping a pin at a supermarket that has a discount on ramen (yes we are poor college students)
5. Dropping a pin on library walk at a booth that is giving out free food.
6. Dropping a private pin where they parked their car.

## Feedback Taken
This web app includes aspects of the events idea. We took the feedback stating that an app like that would be useless since people could find events on Facebook. So this app takes it one step further than facebook in that a pin could be placed on an event saying whether or not it's a good event, whether it's worth going.
