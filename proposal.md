## Feedback Taken
This web app includes aspects of the events idea. We took the feedback stating that an app like that would be useless since people could find events on Facebook. So this app takes it one step further than Facebook in that a pin could be placed on an event saying whether or not it's a good event, whether it's worth going.

## Features
We plan on having a location based app connected to Google Maps, which will allow the community to drop down Cows-shaped pins to indicate good/bad events, long lines, super sales, etc. There may be different cows for the different categories of pins.  These pins will last a specified amount of time (an hour, day, etc). They will be limited to a certain number of pins per hour/day and there will be an upvote system to ensure quality. When one's ratings drops to a certain degree, their cow pin will transform into dead beef.  Furthermore, pins will be restricted to their current location.
