## Project Title
Déjà Moo

## Summary
Communicate with other users in your nearby region! Experience what they're
experiencing; experience Déjà Moo.

## Storyboard
Ideas:
1. Dropping a pin at a job fair for a good company that has a lot of recruiters
2. Dropping a pin on the I-5 to warn people about a traffic accident
3. Dropping a pin at a restaurant warning people about the wait times.
4. Dropping a pin at a supermarket that has a discount on ramen (yes we are poor college students)
5. Dropping a pin on library walk at a booth that is giving out free food.
6. Dropping a private pin where they parked their car.

## Feedback Taken
This web app includes aspects of the events idea. We took the feedback stating that an app like that would be useless since people could find events on Facebook. So this app takes it one step further than Facebook in that a pin could be placed on an event saying whether or not it's a good event, whether it's worth going.
## Features
We plan on having a location based app connected to Google Maps, which will allow the community to drop down Cows-shaped pins to indicate good/bad events, long lines, super sales, etc. There may be different cows for the different categories of pins.  These pins will last a specified amount of time (an hour, day, etc). They will be limited to a certain number of pins per hour/day and there will be an upvote system to ensure quality. When one's ratings drops to a certain degree, their cow pin will transform into dead beef.  Furthermore, pins will be restricted to their current location.
