Unlike the previous iteration, this iteration includes full MongoDB support so the data stays persistent.  We have implemented multiple comments and upvoting for every comment.  We upgraded from using infowindows to infoboxes and overall improved the visuals of the app.  There are preview boxes for each cow that includes the topic and the first comment.  Only one cow's infobox will be open at a time.There are different cows for each cow type; more types will be created in the future.  We have implemented deleteCow so that it only lets you delete a cow if you placed it before refreshing the browser.
