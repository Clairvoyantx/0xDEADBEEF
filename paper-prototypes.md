This prototype shows the user interacting with the app's discovery feature.  By clicking on each individual pin, it will show the different comments the community has written about each event.  The size of the cow shows the popularity of the event (number of comments) and the dead beef signifies a poor event pin (due to trolling).  The user is able to drop a new cow pin, view the top cows, view only certain cow event cateogires, and adjust their account settings.
