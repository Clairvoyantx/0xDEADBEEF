Unlike the previous iteration, this iteration includes a clean login and registration page with full login functionality.  It contains a confirmation for users to delete their own cows and a blue outline to signify their own cows.  Users are now unable to vote on comments unless they are logged in and are only allowed to change the score by 1 (either a downvote or upvote but can change).  The buttons are reorganized to better suit user interactivity.  Preview boxes only show upon hover to make the app cleaner.  The marker clusterer is now a cow rather than the generic marker.
