Unlike the previous iteration, this iteration includes a clean login and registration page with full login functionality.  It contains a confirmation for users to delete their own cows and a blue outline to signify their own cows.  Users are now unable to vote on comments unless they are logged in and are only allowed to change the score by 1 (either a downvote or upvote but can change).  The buttons are reorganized to better suit user interactivity.
